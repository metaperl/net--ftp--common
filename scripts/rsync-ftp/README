rsync.pl
	This script uses File::Find to traverse a directory hierarchy
	and upload the files to a remote machine. If the file has
	already been uploaded then it is not uploaded again.

	This script was written after 1 hour of fighting with rsync.pl
	and not getting it to work!

	So, once I get all 5 gigs of my stuff uploaded elsewhere via
	this script, then I will write rsync2.pl which will only do
	the upload if the uploaded file date is older.

	Note - it requires AppConfig::Std which actually requires a
	number of other things. Get 'em all at CPAN
